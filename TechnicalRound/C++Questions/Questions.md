1. What is the difference between C and C++?
   The main difference between C and C++ are provided in the table below:

Here's a table summarizing the differences between C and C++ in various aspects:

| Aspect                            | C                              | C++                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Programming Paradigm              | Funcation driven ,             | Object-oriented                  |
| Data Hiding, OOps                 | Does not support               | Supports through encapsulation   |
| Language Relationship             | C is a subset of C++           | C++ is a superset of C           |
| Function and Operator Overloading | Not supported                  | Supported                        |
| Namespace                         | Not present                    | Used to avoid name collisions    |
| Functions inside Structures       | Cannot be defined              | Can be defined                   |
| Memory Allocation/Deallocation    | calloc(), malloc(), and free() | new operator and delete operator |

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. This makes it easier to organize and manage large codebases, promote code reuse, and model real-world entities more effectively.

Abstraction and Encapsulation: C++ provides features like classes, access specifiers, and namespaces, which facilitate abstraction and encapsulation. This allows developers to hide implementation details, control access to data and functions, and build more modular and maintainable code.

Standard Template Library (STL): C++ includes a powerful standard library known as the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides generic algorithms, containers (like vectors, lists, maps), and utilities. These components simplify common programming tasks, reduce development time, and improve code quality.

Exceptions Handling: C++ supports exceptions handling, allowing developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code by separating error-handling logic from regular code flow. This can improve code readability and make error handling more robust.
Try: Code that might potentially throw an exception is enclosed within a try block. The try block is followed by one or more catch blocks that handle different types of exceptions.


2. What do you mean by call by value and call by reference?

In call by value method, we pass a copy of the parameter is passed to the functions. For these copied values a new memory is assigned and changes made to these values do not reflect the variable in the main function.

In call by reference method, we pass the address of the variable and the address is used to access the actual argument used in the function call. So changes made in the parameter alter the passing argument.

3.  What are destructors in C++?
    A constructor is automatically called when an object is first created. Similarly when an object is destroyed a function called destructor automatically gets called. A destructor has the same name as the constructor (which is the same as the class name) but is preceded by a tilde.

4.  What is Abstruction in C++?
    = Abstraction is the process of showing the essential details to the user and hiding the details which we don’t want to show to the user or hiding the details which are irrelevant to a particular user .

5.  What is a reference in C++?
    = A reference is like a pointer. It is another name of an already existing variable. Once a reference name is initialized with a variable, that variable can be accessed by the variable name or reference name both.
 
For example-

int x=10;
int &ref=x; //reference variable
If we change the value of ref it will be reflected in x.

6 . What are the C++ access specifiers?
= In C++ there are the following access specifiers:

Public: All data members and member functions are accessible outside the class.

Protected: All data members and member functions are accessible inside the class and to the derived class.

Private: All data members and member functions are not accessible outside the class

7. What is Friend Function in c++ ?
   = A friend function is a special function in C++ that in spite of not being a member function of a class has the privilege to access the private and protected data of a class.

8. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
   =
   -> Shallow copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address, Shallow copy is faster , Shallow copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.
   -> Deep copy makes a new and separate copy of an entire object with its unique memory address , Deep copy is Slower , Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object .

9. What is this pointer in C++?
   = The member functions of every object have a pointer named this, which points to the object itself.
   "this" allows you to access the current object's members and member functions from within its own member functions.

10. Which operator can not be overloaded in C++?
    = "::" 

11. What is an abstract class in c++?
    =
    In C++, an abstract class is a class that is designed to be used as a base class for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of an abstract class. The primary purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface and define common functionality for its derived classes.

An abstract class typically contains one or more pure virtual functions, which are declared using the `virtual` keyword and have no implementation. A pure virtual function is denoted by appending `= 0` to its declaration. By including pure virtual functions, the abstract class specifies an interface that its derived classes must implement.

Here's an example of an abstract class in C++:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double calculateArea() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual void print() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

12. Define token in C++?
    = A token is the smallest individual element of a program that is understood by a compiler. A token comprises the following:

Keywords – That contain a special meaning to the compiler
Identifiers – That hold a unique value/identity
Constants – That never change their value throughout the program
Strings – That contains the homogenous sequence of data
Special Symbols – They have some special meaning and cannot be used for another purpose; eg: [] () {}, ; \* = #
Operators – Who perform operations on the operand



14. Explain inheritance?
    = The capability or ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is known as inheritance. In simple terms, it is a system or technique of reusing and extending existing classes without modifying them.
    It allows us to create a new class(derived class) from an existing class(base class) , and inherit all of the properties of the base class.

15. When should we use multiple inheritance?
    = Multiple inheritances mean that a derived class can inherit two or more base/parent classes. It is useful when a derived class needs to combine numerous attributes/contracts and inherit some, or all, of the implementation from these attributes/contracts. To take a real-life example consider your Parents where Parent A is your DAD Parent B is your MOM and Chid C is you.

16. What is polymorphism in C++?

= Polymorphism is known as many forms of the same thing. In simple terms, we can say that Polymorphism is the ability to display a member function in multiple forms depending on the type of object that calls them.

In other words, we can also say that a man can be an employee to someone, a son of someone, a father of someone, and a husband of someone; this is how polymorphism can be projected in real life.

There is 2 type of polymorphism:

Compile Time Polymorphism
Function Overloading
Operator Overloading

Run Time Polymorphism

Function Overriding


17. What is STL?
    = STL is known as Standard Template Library, it is a library that provides 4 components like container, algorithms, and iterators.

18. Inline Functions in C++?
    = A function is used to reduce the redundancy , as well as save the memory space when a function is invoked a bunch of task is performed like matching arguments ,matching the returns :( , but when the funcation defination is consist of one or two states mensts , there is noting to match the number of arguments , return type , so thats why c++ has somthing called as Inline function.
    // inline int cube(int s) { return s _ s _ s; }


20. When is void() return type used?
    = The void keyword, when used as a function return type, indicates that the function does not return a value.

21. Applications of C++?
    =
    Operating Systems : C++ is most widely used programming language and become an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has majority of parts written in C++ and Most of Microsoft’s software like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer are also written in C++.
    Games : C++ used for game development and companies use it as their first choice to develop gaming systems because C++ is very close to the machine so It can easily manipulate resources and able to built complex 3D games, multiplayer game, etc. Unreal game engine make games using C++.


22. C++ Basic syntax ->

    = Header File: we used the #include <iostream> statement to tell the compiler to include an iostream header file library which stores the definition of the cin and cout methods that we have used for input and output. #include is a preprocessor directive using which we import header files.


    Namespace: A namespace in C++ is used to provide a scope or a region where we define identifiers. It is used to avoid name conflicts between two identifiers as only unique names can be used as identifiers..,

    Identifiers : We use identifiers for the naming of variables, functions, and other user-defined data types. An identifier may consist of uppercase and lowercase alphabetical characters, underscore, and digits. The first letter must be an underscore or an alphabet.

Example:
int num1 = 24;
int num2 = 34;

Keywords
In the C++ programming language, there are some reserved words that are used for some special meaning in the C++ program. It can’t be used for identifiers.

For example, the words int, return, and using are some keywords used in our program. These all have some predefined meaning in the C++ language.

There are total 95 keywords in C++. These are some keywords.

int void if while for auto bool break

this static new true false case char class

23. Pointers & Refernces in C++?
    =

A reference variable is a "reference" to an existing variable, and it is created with the & operator:

Certainly! Both references and pointers in C++ provide the ability to manipulate data indirectly by working with memory addresses. This ability to directly access and modify memory can lead to more efficient code and improved performance compared to languages that do not have these features, such as Python and Java. Let's explore references and pointers in more detail:

References:

A reference is an alias or alternate name for an existing object.
It allows you to create a new name that refers to the same memory location as an existing variable.

```cpp
void increment(int& num) {
   num++;
}

int main() {
   int x = 5;
   int& ref = x;   // ref is a reference to x

   increment(ref); // Modify x through the reference

   std::cout << x; // Output: 6

   return 0;
}
```

Pointer : we can get the memory address of a variable by using the & operator , A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

```cpp

string food = "Pizza";  // A food variable of type string
string* ptr = &food;    // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food

// Output the value of food (Pizza)
cout << food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
cout << &food << "\n";

```

24. float vs. double?

=
float: A float is a single-precision floating-point type. It typically occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory and provides about 7 decimal digits odouble-precision floating-point type. It usually occupies 8 bytes (64 bits) of memory and provides about 15 decimal digits of precision.
Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the difference in precision between `double` and `float` types:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>f precision.
double: A double is a 

int main() {
    double doubleNum = 3.141592653589793238;
    float floatNum = 3.141592653589793238;

    std::cout << std::setprecision(17); // Set precision for output

    std::cout << "Double: " << doubleNum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Float:  " << floatNum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
Double: 3.14159265358979324
Float:  3.14159274101257324
```

In this example, we declare a `double` variable named `doubleNum` and a `float` variable named `floatNum`. Both variables are assigned the value of π (pi) with an extended number of decimal places.

When we output the values, we set the precision using `std::setprecision()` to display a higher number of significant digits.

You can observe that the `double` value retains more precision and accuracy compared to the `float` value. While the `double` value remains consistent with the assigned value of π, the `float` value introduces a small rounding error in the last few decimal places.

This demonstrates that `double` provides greater precision and accuracy with its larger number of significant digits compared to `float`.

25. Operators in C++
    = Arithmetic = + , -
    Logical = && , ||
    Comparison Operators = < , >

26. explain Do/While Loop?
    = do {
    // code block to be executed
    }
    while (condition);
    The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
    int i = 0;
    do {
    cout << i << "\n";
    i++;
    }
    while (i < 5);

27. What is pointer? Pointer of Pointer c++ ?
    = In programming, a pointer is a data type that stores the memory address of another variable or object in the computer's memory. Pointers are widely used in low-level programming and languages like C++ to enable direct memory manipulation and efficient memory access.

In C++, you can declare a pointer using the asterisk (\*) symbol. For example:

```cpp
int* ptr; // Declaration of an integer pointer named 'ptr'
```

To assign the address of a variable to a pointer, you use the address-of operator (&). For example:

```cpp
int x = 42;
int* ptr = &x; // 'ptr' now points to the memory address of 'x'
```

Now, 'ptr' contains the memory address where the integer variable 'x' is stored. By using the pointer, you can access or modify the value of 'x' indirectly.

A pointer to a pointer, also known as a double pointer, is a pointer that stores the address of another pointer. This concept is often used when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or when you need to dynamically allocate memory for a pointer.

Here's how you can declare and use a pointer to a pointer in C++:

```cpp
int x = 42;
int* ptr1 = &x;    // Pointer 'ptr1' points to 'x'
int** ptr2 = &ptr1; // Pointer 'ptr2' points to 'ptr1'

// Accessing the value of 'x' using the double pointer 'ptr2'
int value = **ptr2; // Equivalent to: int value = *ptr1; (which is equivalent to: int value = x;)
```

In this example, 'ptr2' is a pointer to a pointer, and by dereferencing it twice (using `**ptr2`), you can access the value of 'x'.

Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Pointers can be tricky and can lead to bugs like segmentation faults if not used correctly. In modern C++ programming, it is often recommended to use smart pointers and other higher-level abstractions to manage memory and avoid the complexities and potential issues of raw pointers.

28. Java VS c++ ?
    = Below is a comparison between Java and C++,


     - i.  C++ is platform-dependent. Java is platform-independent.
     - ii. C++ is mainly used for system programming.	Java is mainly used for application programming. It is widely used in Windows-based, web-based, enterprise, and mobile applications.
     - iii. C++ supports operator overloading.	Java doesn't support operator overloading.
     -iv. C++ supports both call by value and call by reference.	Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.

29. # What is Modular Approach Programming ?
        The modular approach, also known as modular programming, is a software development technique that emphasizes dividing a program's functionality into self-contained, independent modules or components. Each module represents a specific task or functionality, and these modules can be developed, tested, and maintained separately, making the overall software development process more manageable and organized.


    The key principles of the modular approach include:

    1. **Modularity:** The software is divided into smaller, manageable modules, where each module performs a specific function or a well-defined set of related functions. This improves code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

    2. **Encapsulation:** Each module encapsulates its internal workings, hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary interfaces. This way, other modules can interact with it without needing to understand its internal complexities.

    3. **Abstraction:** Modules provide a higher-level view of the functionality they offer, abstracting the underlying details. This allows developers to work with higher-level concepts rather than getting bogged down by low-level implementation details.

    4. **Reusability:** By designing modules to be independent and self-contained, they can be reused in different parts of the software or even in other projects, saving time and effort.

    5. **Maintainability:** Since modules are isolated and have well-defined interfaces, modifications or bug fixes can be limited to a specific module, making maintenance and troubleshooting more straightforward.

    6. **Scalability:** The modular approach makes it easier to add new features or expand the software by adding or modifying modules without affecting the existing functionality.

    7. **Collaborative Development:** In larger projects, different developers or teams can work on separate modules simultaneously, promoting parallel development and reducing the chances of conflicts.

    Common techniques to implement modularity include the use of functions, classes, libraries, and packages in programming languages. Modular programming is widely used in various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is a fundamental concept in software engineering and promotes the development of robust, maintainable, and extensible software systems.

30 . what is SDLC ?

= SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured approach followed by software development teams to design, create, test, and deploy high-quality software applications. The SDLC process encompasses various phases that guide the development team through the entire software development process. The primary goal of SDLC is to produce efficient, reliable, and scalable software solutions that meet the specific requirements of the end-users or clients. Different organizations may adopt different SDLC models, but the core phases generally remain the same.

Here are the typical phases in the SDLC process:

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis:** In this initial phase, developers work closely with stakeholders, clients, and end-users to gather all the necessary requirements for the software. The team assesses the feasibility of the project, identifies potential risks, and defines the scope of the software.

2. **Planning:** Once the requirements are gathered and analyzed, the development team creates a detailed project plan. This plan includes tasks, schedules, resource allocation, and overall project management strategies.

3. **Design:** In this phase, the system architecture is designed, and the software's technical specifications are prepared. The design may include high-level architecture, database design, user interface design, and other system specifications.

4. **Implementation (Coding):** This is the phase where the actual development of the software takes place. The programmers write the code according to the design specifications. It's essential to follow coding standards and best practices during this phase.

5. **Testing:** Once the implementation is complete, the software undergoes a series of testing to identify and fix defects or issues. Different types of testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) are performed to ensure the software functions correctly.

6. **Deployment:** After the testing phase is successful, the software is deployed to the production environment, making it available to end-users.

7. **Maintenance and Support:** Once the software is in use, there might be a need for ongoing maintenance and support to fix bugs, make enhancements, and ensure it remains compatible with evolving technologies.

It's important to note that various SDLC models exist, such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and DevOps, each with its specific approach to managing the development process. The choice of the SDLC model depends on the project's requirements, complexity, team size, and the organization's development philosophy.

31. Differentiate between stack and queue data structure?
    = To explain the differences between a queue and a stack in C++, let's use a table format in a .txt file to make it easier to read and understand.

**Comparison between Queue and Stack in C++**

| Aspect               |    queue                                                          |  stack
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------

| Ordering of Elements | First-In-First-Out (FIFO)                                         | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)                               
| Insertion            | Elements are added at the rear                                    | Elements are added at the top            

| Deletion             | Elements are removed from the front                               | Elements are removed from the top    

| Example              | A line of people waiting in a queue                               | A stack of plates

|                      | `pop()` (dequeue) to remove the front element                     | `pop()` to remove the top element

|                      | `front()` to access the front element                             | `top()` to access the top element  

| Use Cases            | Task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, etc.            | Expression evaluation, undo/redo functionality, etc. 


   32. Application of Data Structure ?
= A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The real-life applications of all the data structures are discussed below. 

Application of Arrays:
     Arrays are the simplest data structures that store items of the same data type. A basic application of Arrays can be storing data in tabular format. For example, if we wish to store the contacts on our phone, then the software will simply place all our contacts in an array.
 Examples : Book titles in a Library Management Systems.
            Online ticket booking.
            Contacts on a cell phone.
            For CPU scheduling in computer.
            To store the possible moves of chess on a chessboard.
            To store images of a specific size on an android or laptop.


Application of Strings: 
      examples:
                Plagiarism detection.
                Search engine.
                Spell checkers.
                

Application of Linked Lists:
                    examples: Images are linked with each other. So, an image viewer software uses a linked list to view the previous and the next images using the previous and next buttons.
              Web pages can be accessed using the previous and the next URL links which are linked using a linked list.
              The music players also use the same technique to switch between music.
              To keep the track of turns in a multi-player game, a circular linked list is used. 
    

 Application of Stack:
                examples :
                                History of visited websites.
                Message logs and all messages you get are arranged in a stack.
                Call logs, E-mails, Google photos’ any gallery, YouTube downloads, Notifications ( latest appears first ).
                Scratch card’s earned after Google pay transaction.
                Wearing/Removing Bangles, Pile of Dinner Plates, Stacked chairs.             


Application of Queue:
                                examples :  Operating System uses queues for job scheduling.
                To handle congestion in the networking queue can be used.
                Data packets in communication are arranged in queue format.
                Sending an e-mail, it will be queued.
                Server while responding to request
                Uploading and downloading photos, first kept for uploading/downloading will be completed first (Not if there is threading)
                Most internet requests and processes use queue.
                While switching multiple applications, windows use circular queue.
                In Escalators, Printer spooler, Car washes queue.



Application of Priority Queue:
                      Process scheduling in the kernel.
                      Priority queues are used in file-downloading operations in a browser



   33. why Use C++ , Advantages of c++ in interview in simple words mention 5 points? 
    = Certainly! Here are five advantages of using C++ in a simple and concise manner:

1. **High Performance:** C++ allows you to write efficient and fast code, making it ideal for applications that require optimal performance, such as gaming, real-time simulations, and system-level programming.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ supports OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This helps in organizing code, making it more modular and easier to maintain.

3. **Rich Standard Library:** C++ offers a comprehensive standard library with a wide range of functions and classes for various tasks, from data structures and algorithms to file handling and networking.

4. **Mid-level programming language:** Having the features of both a low-level (machine-level) language and a high-level language (user-oriented language that is easily understandable and close to human language), C++ is termed a mil-level or intermediate programming language. C++ is used to develop low-level system applications, such as kernels, drivers, etc., and high-level applications, such as GUIs, desktop applications, etc.

5. **Case-Sensitive:** C++ is case-sensitive, which means that it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. For instance, when we write cout (used to display the output) as ‘Cout’ or “COUT”, the meaning of the term changes. Some programming languages, such as HTML and MySQL, do not care about cases. 

These advantages make C++ a powerful and versatile programming language for a variety of applications and industries.



 34. Exception Handling in c++?
  = Exception handling in C++ is a mechanism that allows you to deal with unexpected or exceptional situations that might occur during the execution of a program. These exceptional situations are often referred to as "exceptions." Exception handling helps you write more robust and fault-tolerant code by separating the error-handling logic from the normal flow of the program.

C++ provides the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords to implement exception handling. Here's how it works:

 **Throwing an Exception (`throw`):** When an exceptional situation occurs in your code, you can "throw" an exception using the `throw` keyword. You can throw various types of objects, including built-in types, custom classes, or even standard library exception classes.

   ```cpp
   if (somethingWentWrong) {
       throw SomeExceptionType("An error occurred");
   }
   ```



35. defination :)
= In data structures and algorithms (DSA), various concepts are used to organize and manage data efficiently. Here are explanations for the terms you mentioned:

1. **Array**:
An array is a linear data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type. Elements are accessed using an index, which represents their position in the array. Arrays offer constant-time access to individual elements, but inserting or deleting elements can be inefficient as it may require shifting elements to accommodate changes.

2. **Linked List**:
A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists allow dynamic insertion and deletion of elements without the need to shift elements like in arrays. There are different types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists (each node points to the next node), doubly linked lists (each node points to both the next and previous nodes), and circular linked lists (the last node points back to the first node).

3. **Tree**:
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It's used to represent a hierarchical structure or relationships between elements. A tree has a root node at the top, and each node can have child nodes connected downward. Nodes with no children are called leaves. Common types of trees include binary trees (each node has at most two children), binary search trees (a binary tree with a specific ordering property), and balanced trees (trees that maintain balance to ensure efficient operations).

4. **Linear Data Structure**:
A linear data structure is one where elements are organized sequentially, like a straight line. Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues are examples of linear data structures. They follow a specific order and have only one direct predecessor and successor for each element.

5. **Non-Linear Data Structure**:
Non-linear data structures do not organize elements sequentially like a line. Instead, elements can have multiple predecessors and successors, forming complex relationships. Trees and graphs are examples of non-linear data structures.

6. **Graph**:
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent relationships between different entities. They are versatile and can model a wide range of real-world scenarios. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). They can also have weighted edges, where each edge has an associated weight or cost.

7. **Vector**:
In computer programming, a vector is often used to refer to a dynamic array or a resizable array. Unlike a traditional array with a fixed size, a vector can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed. Vectors automatically manage the memory allocation and deallocation for the elements they contain. They provide the convenience of arrays while allowing you to avoid some of the challenges of managing memory manually. Vectors are commonly found in programming languages like C++ (where they are part of the Standard Template Library) and other libraries or frameworks.

8. **Two-Dimensional Array**:
A two-dimensional array is an extension of the concept of a one-dimensional array. While a one-dimensional array is like a list of elements, a two-dimensional array is like a table or grid of elements. It's organized into rows and columns, forming a matrix-like structure. Each element in a two-dimensional array is accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

9.                     set	                                      map
1.	Set is used to store all the unique elements.	map is used to store all the unique elements.
2.	Its syntax is -: set<data_type>name_of_set.     Its syntax is -: map<data_type , data_type>name_of_map;
3.	It stores the elements in increasing order	It stores the elements in key , value pairs.
4.	Set is implemented using Binary search tree.	Map is implemented using Balance Binary tree.
5.	Sets are traversed using the iterators. 	It is defined in #include <map> header file.





10. what is graph ?
= A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

11. what is Tree ? 
 = A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child, and the topmost node in the tree is called the root.


12. What is a leaf node? 

Any node in a binary tree or a tree that does not have any children is called a leaf node. 

13.  What is a root node? 

The first node or the top node in a tree is called the root node. 


14. Binary Tree:

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
It is widely used for various applications, including binary search trees (BST), expression trees, and more.


15.  Breadth-First Search (BFS):

BFS is a tree traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores all the nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.
It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be visited. The algorithm follows these steps:


Depth-First Search (DFS):

DFS is a tree traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking to explore other branches.
It can be implemented using either recursion or a stack data structure. Here's the basic idea:
Start at the root node.
Process the current node (e.g., print its value or perform an operation).
Recursively or iteratively visit all of its child nodes one by one, going as deep as possible before backtracking.
Repeat this process for each unvisited child node until all nodes are visited.
DFS has multiple variants, including Preorder DFS (process the node before its children), Inorder DFS (process the left child, then the node, then the right child, often used for binary search trees), and Postorder DFS (process the node after its children).




16. Difference between string and char of array?
= C++ provides two primary ways to work with text data: `std::string` and character arrays (`char[]` or `const char[]`). Here's a comparison of the two with code examples:

1. **`std::string`:**

   `std::string` is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is a dynamic, resizable, and mutable string class. It offers various built-in methods for string manipulation and is generally easier to work with than character arrays.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   int main() {
       std::string cppString = "Hello, C++";

       // Appending to a string
       cppString += " World";

       // Length of the string
       std::cout << "Length: " << cppString.length() << std::endl;

       // Accessing characters
       char firstChar = cppString[0];

       // Printing the string
       std::cout << cppString << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Length: 12
   Hello, C++ World
   ```

2. **Character Array (`char[]` or `const char[]`):**

   Character arrays are arrays of characters and are often used for simple string storage. They are mutable and are usually null-terminated (i.e., have a null character `\0` at the end to mark the end of the string). You need to manage memory and handle many string operations manually.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstring>

   int main() {
       char cString[] = "Hello, C";

       // Concatenating to a character array
       strcat(cString, "++");

       // Length of the string (manually calculated)
       int length = strlen(cString);

       // Accessing characters
       char firstChar = cString[0];

       // Printing the string
       std::cout << "Length: " << length << std::endl;
       std::cout << cString << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Length: 11
   Hello, C++
   ```

**Key Differences:**

- `std::string` is a C++ class with built-in methods for string manipulation, while character arrays require manual string manipulation using functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strlen`, etc.
- `std::string` handles memory management automatically, whereas you need to manage memory explicitly for character arrays.
- `std::string` is dynamic and can resize itself as needed, while character arrays have a fixed size,staticly .
- `std::string` is safer as it performs bounds checking, while character arrays do not.
- `std::string` can store Unicode and multibyte characters easily, while character arrays require more care when dealing with non-ASCII characters.

In general, it's recommended to use `std::string` when working with text in C++ unless you have specific performance or compatibility requirements that necessitate the use of character arrays.

17. Implicit Type Conversion?

The type conversion that is done automatically done by the compiler is known as implicit type conversion. This type of conversion is also known as automatic conversion.

Let us look at two examples of implicit type conversion.


// Working of implicit type-conversion
  ```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   // assigning an int value to num_int
   int num_int = 9;

   // declaring a double type variable
   double num_double;
 
   // implicit conversion
   // assigning int value to a double variable
   num_double = num_int;

   cout << "num_int = " << num_int << endl;
   cout << "num_double = " << num_double << endl;

   return 0;
}
   ```


   C++ Explicit Conversion
When the user manually changes data from one type to another, this is known as explicit conversion. This type of conversion is also known as type casting.

  ```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // initializing a double variable
    double num_double = 3.56;
    cout << "num_double = " << num_double << endl;


    // function-style conversion from double to int
    int num_int2 = int(num_double);
    cout << "num_int2   = " << num_int2 << endl;

    return 0;
}



17. C++ String Functions

C++ provides some inbuilt functions which are used for string manipulation, such as the strcpy() and strcat() functions for copying and concatenating strings. Some of them are:


length()

This function returns the length of the string.

swap() 	
This function is used to swap the values of 2 strings.

size() 

Used to find the size of string

resize()	
This function is used to resize the length of the string up to the given number of characters.

find()	
Used to find the string which is passed in parameters

push_back()	
This function is used to push the passed character at the end of the string 

 find()

This function is used to search for a certain substring inside a string and returns the position of the first character of the substring. 

substr()

This function is used to create a substring from a given string. 

compare()

This function is used to compare two strings and returns the result in the form of an integer.

erase()

This function is used to remove a certain part of a string.
  // Deletes 4 characters from index number 1
    str.erase(1, 4);

pop_back() 

This function is used to pop the last character from the string

clear() 

This function is used to remove all the elements of the string.

begin()

This function returns an iterator pointing to the beginning of the string.

end()

This function returns an iterator that points to the end of the string.



18. Guess the Output :)
= ```c++```

// Online C++ compiler to run C++ program online
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // Write C++ code here
 
int a = 10;
 cout <<a++<<++a<< a++<<a++<<++a<<endl;
	   

    return 0;
}

The code you've provided contains a series of post-increment (a++) and pre-increment (++a) operations on the variable 'a' in the `cout` statement. The result of these operations depends on the order in which they are executed, and the behavior can be undefined in some cases.

Here's a breakdown of whats happening in your code:

1.  `a++` - This will print the current value of 'a' (which is 10) and then increment 'a' by 1. So, it will print 10 and set 'a' to 11.
2. `++a` - This will increment 'a' by 1 and return the new value (which is 12). So, it will print 12.
3. `a++` - This will print the current value of 'a' (which is now 12) and then increment 'a' by 1. So, it will print 12 and set 'a' to 13.
4. `a++` - This will print the current value of 'a' (which is now 13) and then increment 'a' by 1. So, it will print 13 and set 'a' to 14.
5. `++a` - This will increment 'a' by 1 and return the new value (which is 15). So, it will print 15.
6. `endl` - This is an end-of-line character, so it will move to the next line.

Therefore, the output of your code will be: `1012121315`

It's important to note that the order of evaluation of expressions involving multiple increments and decrements in a single statement is undefined behavior in C++. The behavior may vary between different compilers, and you should avoid writing such code for clarity and portability.

19. what is dangling Pointer?
= A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed) is called dangling pointer. There are three different ways where Pointer acts as dangling pointer

int main()
{
    int* ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
 
    // After below free call, ptr becomes a
    // dangling pointer
    free(ptr);
     
    print(ptr);// garbage value 
}

   ```

 20. what is malloc and calloc?
 = In the C programming language, malloc and calloc are functions used to allocate memory dynamically during program execution. They are part of the standard C library (stdlib.h) and are commonly used when you need to allocate memory for data structures like arrays, linked lists, or any other data that you don't know the size of at compile time.


  ***malloc***
  malloc() only takes one argument
  malloc() is faster than calloc.

  ***calloc***
  calloc (Contiguous Allocation):
The calloc function stands for "contiguous allocation."
It allocates memory for an array of elements, where each element is of a specified size.
It takes two arguments: the number of elements you want to allocate memory for and the 


*** c++ relevent ***
 
In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides various container classes like std::vector, std::list, and std::map. These containers automatically manage memory for you, making manual memory management less common.
When you use these containers, you don't need to worry about memory allocation and deallocation; it's handled behind the scenes.

```cpp```

#include <vector>

std::vector<int> vec; // Dynamically resizable array
vec.push_back(42);   // Add elements



21. Typed languages refer to programming languages that have a type system, which defines the rules for how different data types (e.g., integers, strings, arrays) can be used in a program. These rules help catch type-related errors and ensure that data is used in a consistent and safe manner during program execution.

There are two main categories of typed languages: statically typed and dynamically typed.

1. **Statically Typed Language**:
   - In a statically typed language, the data types of variables are determined at compile-time, before the program is executed.
   - Type checking occurs at compile-time, and the compiler verifies that the types of variables and expressions are compatible.
   - If a type mismatch is found during compilation, the program will not be able to run until the error is fixed.
   - Examples of statically typed languages include C, C++, Java, and Swift.

2. **Dynamically Typed Language**:
   - In a dynamically typed language, variable types are determined at runtime, during program execution.
   - Type checking occurs at runtime, and variables can change their type during the course of the program.
   - This flexibility can lead to more concise code but can also make it easier to introduce type-related errors.
   - Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

The relationship between compiled languages and interpreted languages is somewhat separate from the dynamic/static typing distinction:

1. **Compiled Languages**:
   - In a compiled language, the source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate form (bytecode) before execution.
   - Compilation occurs before the program runs, and the resulting binary or bytecode can be executed independently of the original source code.
   - Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Rust.

2. **Interpreted Languages**:
   - In an interpreted language, the source code is executed directly by an interpreter without prior compilation into machine code.
   - The interpreter reads and executes the code line by line or in small chunks, making decisions on the fly.
   - This typically results in slower execution compared to compiled languages but offers greater portability.
   - Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

There's also a category of languages that blend aspects of both compilation and interpretation, such as Java (compiled to bytecode and then executed by the Java Virtual Machine) or C# (compiled to Common Intermediate Language code and executed by the .NET runtime). These languages combine elements of both compiled and interpreted approaches.


1. **High Level Programming Language**
High-level programming languages are designed to be more user-friendly and abstracted from the hardware of the computer.
They provide a higher level of abstraction, making it easier for programmers to write code without needing to have a deep understanding of the computer's architecture.
Examples of high-level programming languages include Python, Java, C++, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.
High-level languages are human-friendly. They are, thus, very easy to understand and learn by any programmer.

2. **Low Level  Programming Language**
These are machine-friendly languages that are very difficult to understand by human beings but easy to interpret by machines.
Some examples of low-level languages include the Machine language and Assembly language.


3. **Big Data**

6. **difference between "a&&b" and "a& b" in programming languages.**


In many programming languages, "&&" represents the logical AND operator, which checks if both operands are true. On the other hand, "&" represents the bitwise AND operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of the two operands.

So, in the context of programming, "a&&b" would typically be used for logical operations, while "a& b" would be used for bitwise operations.

7. **In C++ some common types of operators**

1. Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)
2. Relational operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
3. Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
4. Bitwise operators: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), ~ (bitwise NOT), << (left shift), >> (right shift)

The bitwise operators in C++ with their corresponding signs are:
1. Bitwise AND: &
2. Bitwise OR: |
3. Bitwise XOR: ^
4. Bitwise NOT: ~
5. Left shift: <<
6. Right shift: >>

These operators are used to perform operations at the bit level in C++ programming.

8. A **version control system (VCS)** is a software tool that helps in managing changes to source code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, keeping track of every modification made to the codebase. This enables developers to collaborate effectively, revert to previous versions if needed, and maintain a history of changes. Popular version control systems include **Git**.
