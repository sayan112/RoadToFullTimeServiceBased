Certainly, here are a few more small code snippets with common errors that a fresher might encounter, along with explanations and suggestions:

1. **Uninitialized Variable**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x;
    std::cout << x << std::endl; // Error: Using uninitialized variable x
    return 0;
}
```
In this case, the variable `x` is not initialized before being used, which can lead to undefined behavior. Always initialize variables before using them.

2. **Infinite Loop**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        // Forgot to update i inside the loop
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The loop condition is always true, resulting in an infinite loop. Ensure that loop control variables are properly updated within the loop.

3. **Syntax Error**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" < std::endl; // Error: Incorrect syntax for output
    return 0;
}
```
The `<<` operator is used incorrectly here. It should be `<<` instead of `<`.

4. **Missing Header**:
```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; // Error: Missing #include for <iostream>
    return 0;
}
```
The program uses `std::cout` without including the necessary `<iostream>` header.

5. **Division by Zero**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 0;
    int result = a / b; // Error: Division by zero
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Dividing by zero results in undefined behavior. Always ensure that the denominator is not zero before performing division.

6. **Using Wrong Variable Name**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int NumSquared = num * num; // Error: Using wrong variable name (case-sensitive)
    std::cout << NumSquared << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Variable names are case-sensitive. `NumSquared` is not the same as `numSquared` or `numsquared`.

Remember that as a fresher, encountering and fixing these common errors is a natural part of the learning process. Developing a keen eye for detail, practicing debugging techniques, and continuously improving your code reading and writing skills will help you become a proficient programmer over time.
