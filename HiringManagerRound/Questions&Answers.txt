Top 10 Wipro HR Interview Questions and Answers

Q1. Can you briefly tell us about yourself?
Answer: My name is A and I have finished my graduation from X University. I wish to join the Z sector and I have tried my best to gain the necessary skills for this domain. I have 2 years of work experience (or no work experience) and have a deployed project based on Y. I have finished my schooling at X Higher Secondary School and my hobbies are reading books, swimming and playing the guitar. I also love playing and watching football.
To be Noted: One should be careful about what one answers as the next questions will be based on this. For example, if you have mentioned a hobby, a skill, or a project, you might be getting questions related to those. Thus, one must prepare what to say and be ready to answer questions associated with the things you mention. Also, since this is not a technical interview, one should not go into technical details and the HR interviewer generally does not want that.

Q2. What are your strongest points?
Answer: My strongest points would be dedication, loyalty, and enthusiasm. I also try to be humble, honest, and as collaborative as possible. Cooperation is necessary and I love teamwork. My friends (or colleagues) have mentioned that I have a likable personality and I believe that I have good communication skills. I also believe in goals and I am dedicated to achieving them. It is not great to compliment yourself, but I believe that I would be a good fit for the corporate culture and I have a positive attitude. I am also confident in my work and I maintain the integrity of my initial tasks.
To be Noted: One should not be too overconfident or speak too well about themselves, however, interviews wish to hear that you are goal-oriented and confident about your skills. Being humble is great but you must also get your greatest strengths across. Employers want loyal, honest, and cooperative employees, thus, it is in oneâ€™s best interest to talk about these factors. One should never say that they work better than others or are faster than others. This seems disrespectful and is not the quality of a good leader. One should try to disguise one or two strong points as a weakness and humbly put those across as well. This will make the interviewees think of you as a humble and honest candidate.

Q3. Why do you want to work at Wipro?
Answer: Wipro is a huge MNC and would make me incredibly proud to work in a conglomerate like this. This is an amazing company and most of the employees that I have come across have only good things to say about their experience in Wipro. I believe that I will also get a lot of industry exposure as Wipro handles multiple foreign projects and has a global presence. The company is also a very old company and has a very good track record, I wish to truly be a part of this. I believe that I will get incredible opportunities while working in Wipro and I would like to think that I have a very bright future in this company. More than anything, I would love to work in an Indian giant such as Wipro.
To be Noted: Do not only talk about the strong points of Wipro as the interviewers already know that. Instead, speak about why you would want to join the company and what you expect from the company. Do not speak about salary packages.

Q4. Why should we choose you?
Answer: I would not say that I am better than all the candidates that you have interviewed as I do not know anything about their skills. However, I can speak for myself and assure you that I would work very hard. I am dedicated, honest, and loyal. I also am very goal-oriented and I take my assigned tasks very seriously. I work with team members very well and I am a people person. I like working with others and helping out wherever needed. More than anything, I am confident about the things I know or the skills I have learned, however, I am always open to learning new things. I also wish to work at Wipro for a long time and would not cause the company any trouble while working on a project.

To be Noted: Be humble and never compare yourself with others, however, put your strong points across again. Try to state why it would be a good idea for the company to hire you. Also, mention that you intend to stick to the company.

Q5. What are your weaknesses?
Answer: I am very goal-oriented and I push my team too hard sometimes, however, once the goal is achieved, they definitely do not mind anymore.
To be Noted: Switch the question around in a way that you end up disguising a strong point as a weakness. Do not mention any other thing as this is generally a trick question that is intended to bring out your reaction. Do not ever mention any flaws, instead, try thinking about the question a bit and stick to a strong point that can be disguised as a weakness. 

Q6. What skills do you have for this role?
Answer: Yes, I have gone through the job roles and responsibilities very thoroughly and I believe I have an understanding of what is required. I have also done some additional research and identified the daily tasks one needs to do for this job. This particular job requires me to handle X, Y, Z, and other associated tasks. My responsibility will be to see that A, B and C are operational/progressing. I have gone through several modules to learn X and Y skills due to not having extensive experience, however, I have other skills such as A, B, C, D, E, F, and experience with X and Y technologies.

To be Noted: To answer this question well, one must first go through the job requirements properly from the job portal. One must also research a bit in order to find out what are the daily job roles of the job you are applying to. You must also mention what skills you already had and what additional preparation you have gone through in order to satisfy the job requirements.

Q7. How do you work under stress?
Answer: Due to being very serious about my academics/certifications/training/ job, I am used to being under pressure and I am also good with multitasking. I try to passively transfer the stress by working hard and using my free time to pursue my hobbies. This helps me deal with daily stress and I am able to work with the same energy the next day. I do not mind pressure and I am good with deadlines.

To be noted: This question is a tricky question and one must never react negatively to stress or pressure. One should act like this is a common thing and that one is ready to work under stress. Companies want employees who do not bend under pressure and hamper the workflow.

Q8. Do you like collaboration and teamwork?
Answer: Yes, I absolutely love working with a team. One can learn a lot from their team and their peers. Collaboration makes things easy and fun as well.

To be Noted: One should only speak positive things about teamwork. Employers want to know if the candidate can work with teams as it is absolutely crucial for corporate jobs.

Q9. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Answer: I see myself working in Wipro as a project manager (or a senior developer/specialist) in 5 years. I truly wish to stay in the company and grow with it.
To be Noted: Never mention other companies or something like having your own business. Employers want long-term employees who wish to grow with the company while helping the company grow at the same time. This is a trick question meant to identify your end goal.
 

Q10. Do you have any questions for us?
        Answer: I would love to know more about the work culture and what other things this position entails. I am sure there is much 
         information that is not available online and I would love to have some insight into the position and what my daily routine would be 
           like. I am also excited to learn about Wipro, any interesting facts or stories would be great!

        To be Noted: Research a bit about what you can ask and only ask questions about your position or the company. Never ask about the salary 
         or work location while answering Wipro HR interview questions.
