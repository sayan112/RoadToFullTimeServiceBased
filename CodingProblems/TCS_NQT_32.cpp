// Jack is always excited about sunday. It is favourite day, when he gets to play all day. And goes to cycling with his friends. 

// So every time when the months starts he counts the number of sundays he will get to enjoy. Considering the month can start with any day, be it Sunday, Mondayâ€¦. Or so on.

// Count the number of Sunday jack will get within n number of days.

//  Example 1:

// Input 

// mon-> input String denoting the start of the month.

// 13  -> input integer denoting the number of days from the start of the month.

// Output :

// 2    -> number of days within 13 days.

// Explanation:

// The month start with mon(Monday). So the upcoming sunday will arrive in next 6 days. And then next Sunday in next 7 days and so on.
// Now total number of days are 13. It means 6 days to first sunday and then remaining 7 days will end up in another sunday.Total 2 sundays may fall within 13 days.
