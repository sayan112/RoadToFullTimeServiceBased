1. What do you mean by an operating system? What are its basic functions?

        Operating System (OS) is basically a software program that manages and handles all resources of a computer such as hardware and software. The first OS was introduced in the early 1950s known as GMOs. An OS is responsible for managing, handling, and coordinating overall activities and sharing of computer resources. It acts as an intermediary among users of computer and computer hardware. 

  -   There are many functions of the OS. Some of the important functions of OS are given below:
           1.  Memory and Processor Management
           2.  Providing user interface to users
           3.  File Management and Device Management
           4.  Scheduling of resources and jobs
           5.  Error Detection
           6.  Security

           An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. 
          

2. Types of OS ?
=  Sure, here's a crisp description of each type of operating system:

-    
    1. Batched OS: Processes large data in batches without user interaction. Examples: Payroll Systems, Transaction Processing.

        2. Multi-Programmed OS: Allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by switching the CPU between them. Examples: Windows OS, UNIX.

        3. Timesharing OS: Enables multiple users to interact concurrently by providing time slices for CPU usage. Examples: Multics, UNIX-like systems.

        4. Distributed OS: Runs on interconnected machines, acting as a single system to share resources. Examples: LOCUS, cloud-based systems.

        5. Real-Time OS: Meets strict timing requirements for critical applications. Examples: Real-Time OS are used in various domains such as aerospace, industrial automation, robotics, and telecommunications etc.

        Each OS type caters to specific needs, ensuring efficient processing, multitasking, user interaction, distributed resource management, or real-time performance.


3. What is GUI?
=  GUI (Graphical User Interface) is basically a type of user interface that allows users to use graphics to interact with OS. GUI is created because it is more user-friendly, less complex, and easier to understand rather than a command-line interface. Its main goal is to increase efficiency and ease of use. Instead of having to memorize commands, users can just click on a button to simply execute the procedure. Examples of GUI include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Appleâ€™s iOS, etc.

   1.     What does an Operating system do?
   2.     Process Management
   3.     Process Synchronization
   4.     Memory Management
   5.     CPU Scheduling
   6.     File Management
   7.     Security



5.  What is a process ?

        = In the context of operating systems, a process is an independent program or unit of execution that represents the basic unit of work in a computer system. It is an instance of a computer program that is being executed and managed by the operating system. Each process has its own memory space, which includes the code, data, and other resources required for its execution.

 - States of a Process:
        A process can be in various states during its lifetime. These states represent the different stages a process goes through, from its creation to its termination. The typical process states in most operating systems are as follows:

        1. New: This is the state when a process is being created but has not yet been admitted to the system for execution.

        2. Ready: In this state, the process is prepared to be executed, but the CPU (Central Processing Unit) is not currently executing it. The process is waiting to be assigned CPU time by the scheduler.

        3. Running: When the process is assigned CPU time, it enters the running state, and its instructions are executed by the CPU.

        4. Blocked (or Waiting): In this state, the process is unable to proceed further, typically because it is waiting for some event to occur, such as user input or the completion of an I/O operation. While waiting, the process does not consume CPU time.

        5. Terminated: This is the final state of a process. When a process completes its execution or is explicitly terminated, it enters this state. After termination, its resources are released, and it is removed from the process table.

        The transition between these states is managed by the operating system scheduler and is influenced by various factors such as the availability of CPU time, I/O operations, priority levels, and other resource constraints. The scheduler's role is to determine which process should be in the running state and allocate CPU time fairly among different processes to achieve efficient multitasking and responsiveness in the system.
