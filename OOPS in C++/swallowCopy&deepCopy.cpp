//                                               *********** Deep Copy ***************
// An object is created by copying all the fields, and it also allocates similar memory resources with the same value to the object. To perform Deep copy, we need to explicitly define the copy constructor and assign dynamic memory as well if required. Also, it is necessary to allocate memory to the other constructorsâ€™ variables dynamically. A deep copy means creating a new array and copying over the values. Changes to the array values referred to will not result in changes to the array data refers to.

// In C++, a shallow copy of an object is a copy where the copied object simply points to the same memory address as the original object. This means that any changes made to the copied object will also affect the original object, as they both refer to the same data in memory.

// On the other hand, a deep copy in C++ creates a completely independent copy of the original object. In this case, a new memory space is allocated for the copied object, and all the data from the original object is copied into this new memory space. Consequently, the copied object and the original object have different memory addresses.

// Therefore, it is correct to say that in a shallow copy, the original object and the created copy will point to the same memory address, while in a deep copy, they will have different memory addresses.
