/*
OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a programming methodlogy that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. In object-oriented programming, objects are the fundamental building blocks used to represent real-world entities or abstract concepts. OOP focuses on encapsulating data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into objects, allowing for modular and reusable code.

// In object - oriented programming(OOP) with C++,

// A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.  A class encapsulates data members (properties) and member functions (methods) that operate on those data members.

// An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is created from the class blueprint and represents a specific entity or element that has its own unique state and behavior. You can create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own distinct data values.

// Access specifier defines how the members of the class can be accessed. In C++, there are 3 types of access specifiers: public, private, and protected.
// Access specifier
// public: members can be accessed outside the class.
// private: members cannot be accessed outside the class.
// protected: members cannot be accessed(viewed) from outside the class, but can be accessed in inherited classes(subclasses).

class Dog
{                        // class ClassName
public:                  // Access specifiers
