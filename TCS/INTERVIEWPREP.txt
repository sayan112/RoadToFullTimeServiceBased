Now the devil question comes into the picture.

If we assign you a data entry job and you know that you have to work on data entry for 3 yr then what will you do. Honestly I have no answer for this one like I try to be little diplomatic such as i prepare a lot and any opportunity will come then I will definitely grab that .

Then he ask me that do you prepare for other company as well if company comes in your campus.

Then he again ask data entry question that if you get job in data entry field then what you will do as you have to work on same position for 3 year.Again try to convince him.

Now MR times

MR ask some general question.

And again ask the same data entry question and now this time it made me cry(honestly) they ask same question three time each time i try to convince them but unsuccessful.

He mention we know you are good at coding and things but if we assign you a post of data entry then what is your reaction. I don't know what they want to hear.

Review in the 40 to 45 min first 30 min i was happy but one HR question screw my life and made the environment little bit critical for me.

So prepare for the HR question and best of luck.

And I like to mention that the rank doesn't matter at all I got 463 but no use so be confident with your rank.
